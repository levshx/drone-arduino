# Arduino-based quadrocopter that can be controlled by Android

If there were no bad girls, I would act in porn film, but I'm doing a drone here.

I warn you that this project is not very stable, the controller can not cope with fast processing of all parameters. I would be happy if someone took advantage of this project for the purpose of prototyping and switching to STM or FPGA.

I tried to put the minimum price in the F450, so that this device took off and it could be controlled.
